              I've always been fascitnated with cars. How they work, what makes them tick. I bought a 1976 Fj40; on which I spent 5 years fixing to the beauty it is. I have learned so much from this car. It is so fun for me to learn what makes these complec machines work.

              Ever since I took Computer Science as a Freshman, I have been fascitnated with hwo computers work. Since then, I have built my own computer and have repaired others. I like learning of the new parts and peices and are being created. I love improving my computer, and becoming more knowledgeable.
