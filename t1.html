          I have been playing tennis for almost 5 years now. I have loved it. I enjoy playing with my friends and family. THrough the past couple of years, I have worked hard to improve and become the best I can be. I compete in tournaments and competitions. I plan on participating on the Tennis High School team this spring as a senior. I am super excited for this season.
          <br>
          My favorite players are Nadal, and Fritz.
