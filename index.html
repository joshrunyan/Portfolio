        <p>
          My name is Josh Runyan. I am 17 years old. I live in Heber City, Utah, USA. I am currently attending Wasatch High School as a Senior. I enjoy working and tinkering with things. I spend lots of times thinking of new ideas and inventions that I want to create one day. I enjoy spending time with and friends. I love to have fun and make memories.
          <br>

          I want to go to college after High School. I also want to serve an LDS mission. I am excied for my life to truly begin. For work, I want to work in Information Systems.
